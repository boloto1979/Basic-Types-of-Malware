# - Sockets

This repository contains examples of client-server programs in two different languages: C and Python. Both programs illustrate the basic functioning of sockets to enable communication between a client and a server through a TCP/IP connection.

## Contents of the repository

- `server_socket.c`: The server implemented in the C language.
- `client_socket.c`: The client implemented in the C language.
- `server_socket.py`: The server implemented in Python.
- `client_socket.py`: The client implemented in Python.

## Program Functionality

### C Version

The C version consists of two programs: `server_socket.c` (server) and `client_socket.c` (client). They use the operating system's socket library to create and manage TCP/IP connections.

#### Server (`server_socket.c`)

1. The server creates a socket using `socket()` and specifies the address domain (AF_INET for IPv4) and socket type (SOCK_STREAM for TCP).
2. It then sets up the `struct sockaddr_in` structure with the IP address and port it wants to listen on.
3. The server binds the created socket to this address using `bind()`.
4. It enters a listening mode with `listen()` and waits for client connections.
5. When a client connects using `accept()`, a new connection is accepted, creating a new socket for communication with that client.
6. The server sends an initial message to the client using `send()` and receives a response from the client using `recv()`.
7. After communication, the server closes the sockets and concludes its execution.

#### Client (`client_socket.c`)

1. The client creates a socket similar to the server using `socket()`.
2. It sets up the `struct sockaddr_in` structure with the server's IP address and port it wants to connect to.
3. The client uses `connect()` to establish a connection with the server.
4. It receives the initial message from the server using `recv()` and sends a response using `send()`.
5. After communication, the client closes the socket and concludes its execution.

### Python Version

The Python version also consists of two programs: `server_socket.py` (server) and `client_socket.py` (client).

#### Server (`server_socket.py`)

1. The server creates a socket object using `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`, specifying the address domain (AF_INET for IPv4) and socket type (SOCK_STREAM for TCP).
2. The server calls `bind()` to associate the socket with a specific IP address and port.
3. It then enters a listening mode with `listen()` and waits for client connections.
4. When a client connects using `accept()`, the server accepts the connection and obtains the client's socket object.
5. The server sends an initial message to the client using `send()` and receives a response from the client using `recv()`.
6. After communication, the server closes the socket and concludes its execution.

#### Client (`client_socket.py`)

1. The client also creates a socket object using `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`.
2. It sets up the server's IP address and port using a tuple `(ip, port)`.
3. The client uses `connect()` to establish a connection with the server.
4. It receives the initial message from the server using `recv()` and sends a response using `send()`.
5. After communication, the client closes the socket and concludes its execution.

## How to Use

1. Choose the desired version: C or Python.
2. Ensure you have the appropriate compiler and development environment for the C language or the Python interpreter installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where the files corresponding to the chosen version (C or Python) are located.
4. Compile and execute the server first. For example, in C, you can compile using `gcc server_socket.c -o server_socket`, and in Python, simply run `python server_socket.py`.
5. Next, compile and execute the client. In the case of C, use `gcc client_socket.c -o client_socket`, and in Python, run `python client_socket.py`.
6. The client will connect to the server and initiate communication. You will see confirmation messages in the terminal indicating that the connection has been established and that data has been sent and received successfully.
7. After communication, both the client and server will close, and you are free to run them again if desired.

Please note that when running the server and client on different systems, you should replace the IP address `127.0.0.1` with the corresponding IP addresses on the network they are being executed on.

These simple examples of client-server communication using sockets can serve as a foundation for building more complex and robust applications.
