# WIndows API

## Introduction
This repository contains two C++ programs: one for Windows (`exec_shellcode.cpp`). Both programs aim to allocate executable memory, copy shellcode into that memory region, and then execute the shellcode as native code. The shellcode is provided as a sequence of bytes in hexadecimal format.

## Functionality

### Windows Shellcode Execution (`exec_shellcode.cpp`)
The `exec_shellcode.cpp` program is for Windows and utilizes the Windows API to allocate an executable memory region. It copies the shellcode to this allocated memory region and then creates a new thread to start executing the shellcode. Here are the main steps:

1. Shellcode Definition: The shellcode is defined as a sequence of bytes in hexadecimal format, stored in the `shellcode[]` character array.

2. Allocate Executable Memory: The program uses the `VirtualAlloc` function to allocate a memory region with execution permissions. The function returns a pointer to the allocated memory, which is stored in the `exec_mem` variable.

3. Copy Shellcode: The program uses `RtlMoveMemory` to copy the shellcode into the allocated memory region.

4. Create a New Thread: The `CreateThread` function is used to create a new thread that starts executing the shellcode.

5. Program Termination: The program waits for a short period (`Sleep(1000)`) before terminating.

## Important Notice
Executing shellcode is a risky task and can be dangerous for the system if not done carefully. Shellcode is often used in software exploits and attacks, and therefore, executing unknown or malicious shellcode can cause serious harm to the system and data.
