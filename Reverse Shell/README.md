# Reverse Shell

## What is a Reverse Shell?

A Reverse Shell is a technique used in information security to gain remote access to a target computer, allowing an attacker to execute commands on that system and receive the output of those commands back. This technique is called "reverse" because, unlike the traditional shell where the client (user's terminal) connects to the server (target computer) to execute commands, in the Reverse Shell, the server (target computer) connects to the client (attacker's computer) to receive commands.

It is important to note that the use of Reverse Shell may be considered illegal and unethical if performed without proper consent from the owner of the target system. This technique is often employed by information security professionals and pentesters as part of security testing and auditing on systems to identify vulnerabilities and enhance the security of the environment.

## Program: rev-shell.cpp

The "rev-shell.cpp" program is a C++ code that implements a Reverse Shell for Windows operating systems. The code uses the ´winsock2.h´ socket library for network communication and the Windows API for process manipulation.

### Program Execution:

1. The program starts by initializing the network libraries using the `WSAStartup` function.
2. Next, it creates a socket using the `WSASocket` function, configuring it to use an IPv4 address and the TCP protocol.
3. It sets the IP address of the remote server and the port number to be used for the connection.
4. It attempts to establish a connection with the remote server using the `WSAConnect` function.
5. If the connection is successful, the program enters the "else" block:
   - It receives data sent by the remote server using the `recv` function.
   - It creates a new process that executes "cmd.exe" (the Windows command prompt) using the `CreateProcess` function, allowing the user to send commands to the target system.
   - It waits for the process to complete using the `WaitForSingleObject` function.
   - It closes the handles of the process and the thread using the `CloseHandle` functions.
6. The program terminates after executing the commands and completing the process.

### How to Use the Program:

**Important:** Before using this program, ensure that you have explicit authorization from the owner of the target system to perform any form of access or security testing.

1. Open the "rev-shell.cpp" file in a code editor or IDE that supports the compilation of C++ programs for Windows.
2. Locate the line that defines the IP address and change the value of "ip_addr" to the address of the server you wish to connect the reverse shell.
3. If necessary, change the value of the "port" to an available and known value on the remote server.
4. Compile the program into an executable using a suitable C++ compiler for Windows, such as MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio.
5. Place the executable of the program on the target system.
6. Run the program on the target system.
7. If everything is set up correctly, and the server is available, the program will connect to the server, and you can start sending commands remotely to the target system through the server.

Please remember that misusing this program on systems without proper authorization is illegal and may result in severe legal consequences. Use these techniques only for legitimate and ethical purposes, such as security testing on systems for which you have permission to evaluate.
